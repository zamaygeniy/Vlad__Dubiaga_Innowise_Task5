	"content" : "I love TikTok. However, I've recently had a lot of issues. First, I couldn't use all the filters. I kept getting notifications that the filter couldn't be used on my phone. I can use them all now, but now the captions are messed up. Other reviews say the captions don't show up at all, but I get double captions! It's infuriating. I've tried turning them off under accessibility, but that does nothing.",

BUT ever since it's updated the videos are slow, the sound carries over from the last video played and keeps replaying, you swipe for the next video and it doesn't play, the lives get stuck on one motion pic. I've restarted my phone, quit the app but I believe it's the app it's self acting weird. I'm not liking it right now.",
